# Welcome to your MTA Tracker app ðŸ‘‹
MTA Bus Alerts is a simple, beginner-friendly React Native app designed to keep riders informed about bus and subway service alerts in New York City. Our team wanted to build something useful for everyday commuters while learning how to set up a mobile app project.


## Tech Stack

UI: React Native + Expo

Navigation: Expo Router

Language: JavaScript/TypeScript

Backend: Express.js (mock API)

Data: MTA GTFS and MTA Service Alerts API (attempted integration, but used mock data due to complexity)

## Get started

1. Install dependencies for the frontend

   ```bash
   cd frontend 
   npm i 
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. Install dependencies for the backend 
   ```bash
   cd backend 
   npm i 
   ```
4. Start the server
   ```bash
   npm run 
   node server.js
   ```

## Usage & Features

-View a list of subway & bus alerts

-Alerts show line name, description, and status 

-Beginner-friendly UI with clean layout

-Built as a demo app since connecting to the live MTA API was too complex in the time frame

## Future Features to Implement

-Direct integration with MTAâ€™s live API

-Push notifications for urgent alerts

-Filtering by line (bus vs subway, specific route)

-Map view showing nearby stations with issues
